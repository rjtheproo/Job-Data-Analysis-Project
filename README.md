# Job-Data-Analysis-Project
Job Data Analysis Project (Beginner).  This is a project where I analyze job data, including job titles, salaries, and trends related to remote work. It's a learning project where I use Python, data analysis libraries like pandas and matplotlib, and visualizations to explore and understand job market trends.  
I used the data from Luke Barousse's dataset available on hugging face and made an attempt to make some basic analysis on job postings based on salaries, locations, skills etc.
